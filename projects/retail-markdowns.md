# Retail Markdowns Project

## 📌 Overview
This project automates Store Specific price change list creation for retail stores.  
Managers previously had to manually cross-check price changes in MIM (Merchandise Inventory Management); I built a Python solution that:
- Matches store inventory with corporate markdown lists
- Produces store-specific markdown files
- Saves hours of manual effort across the fleet

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python (pandas, openpyxl, matplotlib)**
- **Excel automation**
- **PDF generation (matplotlib + reportlab)**

---

## 🔑 Key Features
- Automatically matches markdowns against current store inventory
- Generates Excel and PDF reports per store
- Groups by **site**, **style**, **width**, and **price**
- Adds **summary sheet** with per-site markdown % and averages to show impact.
